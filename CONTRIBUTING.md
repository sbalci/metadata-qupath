## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- QuPath 0.6.0+ installed and working
- Basic understanding of Groovy scripting
- Access to sample WSI files for testing
- Git and GitHub account

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sbalci/metadata-qupath.git
   cd qupath-cohort-extractor
   ```

2. **Set up your development environment**:
   - Install QuPath 0.6.0+
   - Copy scripts to your QuPath scripts directory
   - Create a test project with sample images

3. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting changes, please test with:
- **Multiple scanner types** (if available)
- **Different image formats** (SVS, TIFF, etc.)
- **Various image sizes** (small and large files)
- **Edge cases** (corrupted files, missing metadata)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Script runs without errors in QuPath
- [ ] Output CSV contains expected columns
- [ ] Metadata extraction works for your target scanner/format
- [ ] Processing log shows appropriate messages
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for large projects
- [ ] Changes don't break existing functionality

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Follow existing conventions** in the codebase
- **Comment your code** thoroughly, especially complex algorithms
- **Use descriptive variable names** that are clear to pathologists
- **Handle errors gracefully** with appropriate logging

### Commit Messages
Write clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
feat: add support for Hamamatsu NanoZoomer metadata
fix: resolve pixel size extraction for Aperio CS2

## üè• Pathologist Contributors

### Non-Coding Contributions
You don't need to be a programmer to contribute:
- **Testing with your images**: Help validate the tool with real clinical data
- **Documentation feedback**: Improve instructions from a user perspective
- **Feature suggestions**: Propose improvements based on clinical workflow needs
- **Bug reports**: Report issues you encounter in your work

### Clinical Validation
Help us ensure the tool works in real-world scenarios:
- Test with diverse tissue types and staining protocols
- Validate metadata accuracy against known image parameters
- Report discrepancies in scanner metadata interpretation
- Suggest clinical workflow improvements

## üî¨ Scanner-Specific Contributions

### Adding New Scanner Support
To add support for a new scanner:

1. **Gather sample files** and metadata examples
2. **Analyze the metadata structure** (use QuPath's Image Information dialog)
3. **Map metadata fields** to our standard schema
4. **Add extraction logic** in the appropriate section
5. **Test thoroughly** with multiple samples
6. **Document the mapping** for future reference

### Metadata Field Mapping
When adding new fields, consider:
- **Standardization**: Use consistent naming across scanners
- **Clinical relevance**: Focus on fields useful for analysis
- **Compatibility**: Ensure fields work across different software versions
